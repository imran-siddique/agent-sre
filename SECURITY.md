## Security Best Practices for Users

- **Keep dependencies updated:** Regularly run dependency audits and update to the latest versions.
- **Use environment variables for secrets:** Never hardcode credentials, API keys, or tokens in configuration files.
- **Enable access controls:** Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring agent permissions.
- **Review configurations:** Audit your deployment configurations against the provided security guidelines.
- **Monitor for advisories:** Watch this repository for security advisories and release notes.
- **Use signed commits:** Enable GPG or SSH commit signing to ensure code integrity.
- **Run in isolated environments:** Use containers or sandboxed environments for agent workloads.

## Agent Governance Ecosystem
